#  Spring festival project

## we will continue our Christmas holiday project. We are able to convert a picture into a lot typical points which represents the organs on our face now. what we need to achieve is a use interface. Then we can utilize the camera on the computer to grip pictures every several seconds and create an algorithm to compare the similarity between the pictures and the target emotions. I am in the group with Kevin Chen.The link to his project is <https://github.com/chenkewei99/2017A2CS>
