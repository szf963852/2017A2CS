# Study notes from Godfrey
### Chapter 17: Communication and Internet Technologies

- 17.01 Isolated network topologies:
  1. point to point
  2. bus 
  3. ring 
  4. mesh 
  in this configuration, each end-system has a point-to-point connection to each of the other endsystems. 
  5. star
       In a star topology, each end-system has a point-to-point connection to the 'central' device

- 17.02 Communication and transmission concepts 
   Data flow modes,Message types, Transmission modes, Packet-switching services

- 17.03 Hardware connection devices
An end-system on an Ethernet LAN needs a network interface card (NIC). Each NIC has a unique 'physical' addressã€‚The end-system itself has no identification on the network. If the NIC is removed and inserted into a different end-system, it takes the address with it.
